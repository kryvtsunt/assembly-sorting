Write an assembly program that sorts an array of integers.

The program should:

Input the size of the array.
Allocate space for the array on the heap.
Input the numbers in the array, one per line.
Call a sorting function, which returns a sorted version of the input array.
The sort function should allocate a new array for its output, and not mutate the input array.
Output the original array.
Output the sorted array.
The arrays you print must be a sequence of numbers on one line separated by a single space.
For normal credit, implement Gnome Sort

For extra credit (+10 out of 100 points), instead implement Stooge Sort. To claim your extra credit, make sure to note that you're attempting extra credit in the submission notes.
